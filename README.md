# days-since-app

Motivaltional web app using Vue.js. Keep track of how many days it has been since you last did some activity. For example if you are trying to go for a run once a week, you can see if your last run was more than seven days ago.

This was made in a few hours after the idea popped in my head one Sunday afternoon.
